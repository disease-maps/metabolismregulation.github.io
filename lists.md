## Reactome-Recon lists

Reactome-Recon lists were generated automatically using a combination of two resources: the Reactome Neo4j graph database ([Fabregat et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005968)) and the Recon Neo4j graph database ([Balaur et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw731)) of the Human Metabolic Network Reconstruction Recon2 ([Thiele et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2488)).

<a href="/standalone-proteins/">Table 1</a> includes proteins from the Human Metabolic Reconstruction Recon2 that match those in Reactome pathways and participate in signalling processes, the cases when a protein connected to a process via production or consumption arcs.

Table 2 (in preparation) inlcudes proteins from the Recon2 that are also part of complexes in Reactome pathways that participate in signalling processes.
