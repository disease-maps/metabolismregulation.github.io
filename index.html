<p>Welcome to the <strong>Metabolism Regulation Project</strong>, an effort focused on describing the connections between signalling and metabolic networks important for the regulation of metabolic processes, their role in health and disease.<p/>

<p>The project is designed as an open community framework: any student, researcher or group can join and contribute. We are actively looking for collaborators and encourage to contact us if you are interested in metabolism regulation, modelling and practical applications.<p/>

<p>To learn more about the project please review the gallery of the available diagrams developed in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, Le Novere, 2009, PMID ). There is a list of selected topics that are already in work or prepared for curation. We aim to provide the results in various formats including SBGN, SBML and BioPAX so the models are accessible and can be easily used and improved.<p/>
