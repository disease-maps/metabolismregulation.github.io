<p>Welcome to the <strong>Metabolism Regulation Project</strong>, an effort focused on identifying and describing connections between signalling and metabolic networks important for the regulation of metabolic processes, and a better understanding of their role in health and disease.<p/>

<p>The project is designed as an open community framework: any student, researcher or group can join and contribute. We are actively looking for collaborators and encourage to <a href="/about/">contact us</a>. We are especially interested in involving students and young researchers. The pieces we are working on can be developed during a short period of time while interacting with experienced experts.

<p>To learn more about the project, please review the gallery of the <a href="/maps/">available diagrams</a> developed in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, Le Novère et al., 2009). There is a list of <a href="/list/">selected topics</a> that are already in work or prepared for curation. We aim to provide the results in various formats including SBGN, SBML, BioPAX and CellDesigner formats so the models are easily accessible and can be downloaded, reused and improved.<p/>
