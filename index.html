<p>Welcome to the <strong>Metabolism Regulation Project</strong>, an effort focused on identifying and describing connections between signalling and metabolic networks important for the regulation of metabolic processes, and a better understanding of their role in health and disease.<p/>

<p>The project is designed as an open community framework. We are actively looking for collaborators and interested in involving students and young researchers. Topics can be explored and curation done during a short period of time while interacting with experienced experts.

<p>To learn more about the project, please review the available <a href="/maps/">maps</a>, a collection of diagrams in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN). There is a list of <a href="/list/">selected topics</a> that are already in work or being prepared for curation. We aim to provide maps in various formats including SBGN, SBML, BioPAX and CellDesigner formats so the models are easily accessible and can be downloaded, reused and improved.<p/>
