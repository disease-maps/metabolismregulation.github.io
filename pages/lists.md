# Reactome-Recon lists

Reactome-Recon lists were generated automatically using a combination of two resources: the Reactome Neo4j graph database ([Fabregat et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005968)) and the Recon Neo4j graph database ([Balaur et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw731)) of the Human Metabolic Network Reconstruction Recon2 ([Thiele et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2488)).

### <a href="/reactome-recon-proteins/">Reactome-Recon List 1 - Proteins</a>
  
The list includes proteins from Recon2 that match those in Reactome pathways and participate in signalling processes in Reactome pathways as a reactant or a product, the cases when a protein is connected to a process via a production or a consumption arc.

### <a href="/reactome-recon-complexes/">Reactome-Recon List 2 - Complexes</a>

This list inlcudes proteins from Recon2 that are also involved in the complexes that participate in signalling processes in Reactome pathways as reactants or products.
