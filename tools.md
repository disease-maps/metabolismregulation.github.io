# yEd Graph Editor
        
<p><a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed" target="_blank">yEd Graph Editor</a> from yWorks GmbH is a freely available graph editor written in Java that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux/Unix. It is a powerful desktop application that can be used to quickly and effectively generate high-quality diagrams.</p>
        
<p>yEd uses the XML-based GraphML format to load/save diagrams and additionally supports import from Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx) and arbitrary XML (via XSLT). Creating diagrams manually is easy and fun with the intuitive user interface, and a large collection of powerful layout algorithms allows to automatically arrange nodes and edges. Diagrams can be exported to bitmap and vector formats: PNG, JPG, and SVG, PDF.</p>
        
<p>Since <a href="https://www.yworks.com/products/yed/download#ReleaseNotes" target="_blank">version 3.17.1</a> yEd provides a palette section for Systems Biology Graphical Notation.</p>
        
# Newt Editor

<p><a href="http://newteditor.org/" target="_blank">Newt Editor</a> is a free, web-based, open-source viewer and editor for pathways in Systems Biology Graphical Notation.  It is written with a series of libraries and extensions based on <a href="http://js.cytoscape.org/" target="_blank">Cytoscape.js</a>.</p>
        
<p>Newt is developed to make it easy to design SBGN diagrams: rich yet minimalistic user-friendly IU; support for developing maps from scratch; automatic layout facilities; full support for complexes, compartments and submaps; state-of-the-art complexity management through hide-show and collapse-expand functionalities; advanced diagramming with grid and alignment support, resizing and styling map objects, and more.</p>

# SBGN-ED

<a href="www.sbgn-ed.org/" target="_blank">SBGN-ED</a> is an open-source software, a VANTED add-on, which allows to create and edit in all three SBGN languages: Process Description, Entity Relationship and Activity Flow (Czauderna et al., 2010, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq407" target="_blank">doi:/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq407</a>). SBGN-ED supports the latest version of the SBGN standard. It offers a validation tool that highlights parts that did not pass verification.

# CellDesigner

<p><a href="http://www.celldesigner.org" target="_blank">CellDesigner</a> is a diagram editor developed by the Systems Biology Institute for drawing process diagrams (Kitano et al., 2005, PMID <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19668183" target="_blank">19668183</a>) using the graphical notation proposed by Prof. Hiroaki Kitano, and stored in <a href="http://sbml.org/" target="_blank">SBML</a> format. CellDesigner supports the development of mathematical models and is integrated with SBML ODE Solver, SBML Simulation Core and Copasi. The entities on a diagram can be annotated and linked to various databases.</p>
        
<p>CellDesigner supports a system of symbols based on a draft of the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) Process Description language Level 1 proposed in 2008 (more information can be found <a href="http://www.celldesigner.org/features.html" target="_blank">here</a>). <a href="http://www.celldesigner.org/help/CDH_View_08.html" target="_blank">SBGN Viewer</a> tool in CellDesigner can be used to see a diagram in the current version of <a href="http://sbgn.org/" target="_blank">SBGN</a> (Le Nov√®re et al., 2009, PMID <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19668183" target="_blank">19668183</a>).</p>
