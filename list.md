* <a href="/glycolysis/">Regulation of glycolysis via PFKFB</a>
* <a href="/mevalonate/">Regulation of mevalonate biosynthesis</a>
* <a href="/eicosanoids/">Regulation of eicosanoid production</a><br />
* Regulation of glycogen metabolism<br />

# Automatically generated list of connections

The list of connections was generation using the following logic: we are interested in proteins from the Human Metabolic Reconstruction Recon2 that also are in Reactome pathways and particpate in signalling processes - processes that have this protein connected to it via production or consumption arcs.
