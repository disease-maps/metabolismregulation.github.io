# Selected topics

The list of the developed diagrams that can be improved and suggested topics. Some initial information for suggested topics is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gk5YU7tp95t3LJwD252geeZupY-QJU6CikFAbsRQeRI/edit?usp=sharing).

* <a href="/glycolysis/">Regulation of glycolysis via PFKFB</a>
* <a href="/mevalonate/">Regulation of mevalonate biosynthesis</a>
* <a href="/eicosanoids/">Regulation of eicosanoid production</a><br />
* Regulation of glycogen metabolism<br />
* Regulation of cholesterol metabolism via SREBP<br />
* Metabolic control of acetyl-CoA production<br />

# Recon2-Reactome connections

This list was generated automatically using the Human Metabolic Network Reconstruction Recon2 [Thiele et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2488) transformed into New4j Graph Database format [Balaur at al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw731), and the Reactome Neo4j graph database [Fabregat et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005968).

The following logic was used: we are interested in 1) proteins from the Human Metabolic Reconstruction Recon2 that also are in Reactome pathways and particpate in signalling processes - processes that have this protein connected to it via production or consumption arcs; 2) proteins from the Human Metabolic Reconstruction Recon2 that also are a part of complexes in Reactome pathways that participate in signalling processes.
