# How to draw SBGN diagrams in yEd

yEd Graph Editor is a general-purpose digramming tool. Some adjustments are required for drawing SBGN diagrams, mainly in connection to auxilary units (state variables and units of information) and ports for processes (they are not implemented as in dedicated SBGN editors). 

## Modifying general settings

After downloading and installing yEd Graph Editor, we suggest following adjustments:

* Place SBGN palette to the top of the Palette section (top-right):  
**Edit > Manage Palette...**  
Here you can delete unwanted palettes and define in what order they will be shown.
* Make links go under the shapes (this way they will not cross auxiliary units):  
**Preferences > Display > Paint Nodes Over Edges**

## Auxiliary units

Right click on the shape > Convert to Label
Right click on the label > Convert to Node

## Processes
