# How to draw SBGN diagrams in yEd

## Modifying general settings

* The SBGN palette can be placed to the top of the palette section: Edit > Manage Palette. Here you can delete unwanted palettes and define in what order palettes will be shown.  

* Making shapes painted over links (this way links will not cross auxiliary units): Preferences > Display > Paint Nodes Over Edges. Still, in case of incoming links, arrowheads might be partly hidden behind an auxiliary unit. Then the coordinates of the port can be modified manually by dragging the port or by typing in new coordinates.

## Auxiliary units

Right click on the shape > Convert to Label
Right click on the label > Convert to Node

## Process's "bars"

In addition to snap-to-guideline feature of yEd, there is snap-to-bend-point feature. This feature is to be used to colocate bent points as if they were ports of a process.

## Tips

* To modify all objects of the same type: go to 'Current Elements' palette at the bottom of the palette section, select an element, right click > Select Matching Elements.

* To make smooth bend points: right click on a link > Properties > Bends > Smooth Bends.

* To modify font size for all objects: Cntr-A on Windows or Command-A on Mac, then edit using Properties View.
